<h3>General guidelines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Try to book an appointment in the morning. Avoid evening session appointments. If the doctor suggests a procedure, the equipment might not be available in the evening and you'll have to go again on the next day.</li>
    <li>Once you reach the hospital, go to the outpatient department. Find a self-service kiosk, enter your details, and obtain a queue number. Afterwards wait for your queue number to be called, meet the doctor, and if prescribed, pay for and get some procedure done.</li>
    <li>Payment is done via WeChat. Do ensure your WeChat pay is set up for payment in the Mainland and take a data SIM along.</li>
    <li>The hospital is right next to the Shenzhen Bay Park Metro Station. It can be reached via metro, bus, and taxi. Some guidelines are given on this <a href="https://www.hku-szh.org/en/MakeanAppointment(HK-Macao-Residents)/GettingtoHKUSZH/index.html">link</a>.</li>
    <li>If you go early or need to wait for a while, you can wait inside the hospital or you can walk to the Shenzhen Bay Park and wait there.</li>
  </ul>
